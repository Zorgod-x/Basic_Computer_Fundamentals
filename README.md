### Very Basic Computer Fundamentals
* **Basic BIOS Configurations**
  * **Boot Sequence :**<br>
  The boot sequence determines the order in which the computer checks for and boots from different storage devices (e.g., hard drive, USB drive, CD/DVD drive).
  * **Enabling / Disabling Devices :** <br/>
   BIOS settings allow users to enable or disable various hardware components, such as USB ports, integrated audio, onboard graphics, or network adapters.
  * **Changing Date / Time :** <br/>
   BIOS includes a real-time clock (RTC) that keeps track of the system's date and time. Users can set or adjust the date and time in BIOS to ensure accurate timestamps for files and system logs.
    * **CMOS Batteries :**<br/>
    BIOS settings are stored in CMOS (Complementary Metal-Oxide-Semiconductor) memory, which requires a small battery to maintain these settings even when the computer is powered off.
  * **CPU Clockspeeds :**<br/>
  BIOS allows users to configure CPU clockspeed settings, including the base clock frequency and the multiplier. Overclocking enthusiasts often use these settings to increase CPU performance.
  * **BIOS Firmware Upgrades :**<br/>
  Often referred to as BIOS updates or flashing the BIOS, involve updating the firmware on the motherboard to add new features, improve compatibility, or fix security vulnerabilities. This process should be done with caution.
  * **Enabling Virtualization Support :**<br/>
  Some CPUs support hardware-assisted virtualization, which is crucial for running virtual machines efficiently. In BIOS, users can enable or disable virtualization technology (e.g., Intel VT-x or AMD-V) to enhance virtualization performance.
  * **Secure Boot _(Basic Understanding)_ :**<br/>
  Secure Boot is a security feature that prevents the loading of unauthorized or malicious software during the boot process. It verifies the digital signatures of bootloader files to ensure they haven't been tampered with. Users can typically enable or disable Secure Boot in BIOS.

* **Hard Drive Basics**
  * **Magnetic HDDs :**<br/>
  Magnetic HDDs use spinning platters coated with a magnetic material to store data. An actuator arm with read/write heads moves over the platters to read or write data. They provide high-capacity storage at a lower cost but are slower and less durable than SSDs.
  * **SSDs :**<br/>
  SSDs use NAND flash memory to store data. They are faster, more energy-efficient, and durable than HDDs because they have no moving parts
  * **eMMC :**<br/>
  eMMC is a type of flash storage used in many mobile devices and budget laptops. It's an integrated solution where the storage and controller are combined into a single chip. While eMMC is cost-effective, it's slower than SSDs.
  
* **Partitioning :** <br/>
  Partitioning involves dividing a hard drive or SSD into multiple logical sections or partitions. Partitions can help organize data, separate the operating system from user data, or facilitate multi-boot setups.
    * **FAT32 :**<br/>
    FAT32 is a file system format that can be used for storing files on hard drives, USB drives, and memory cards. It's a simple and widely compatible format but has limitations, such as a maximum file size of 4 GB.
    * **NTFS :**<br/>
    NTFS is a file system format used primarily in Windows operating systems. It offers features like file compression, encryption, access control
    * **ext2, ext3, ext4 :**<br/>
    These are file system formats used in Linux and other Unix-like operating systems, ext4 is the most commonly used version today.
  * **MBR _(Legacy)_  :**<br/>
  MBR is a legacy boot sector that was widely used to manage partition information and bootloaders in older computer systems.
  * **EFI / UEFI :**<br/>
  EFI/UEFI is a modern replacement for the traditional BIOS. It provides an interface between the operating system and the hardware. UEFI is more secure and versatile, supporting larger hard drives and newer security features like Secure Boot.<br/>
